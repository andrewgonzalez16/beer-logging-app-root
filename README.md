# BeerLoggingAppRoot
The root repository for the beer logging app.
As a craft beer enthusiast, I love beer and have drank too many unique beers to remember them all. Thus I wanted to create a personal app that I can use to log beer in addition to other information such as location, date, etc.. While the Untapped app is great for doing exactly this, I do believe a much lighter version of the app in addition to UI improvements could be made, and thus I decided to take it upon myself and create an alternative. This is my first app, I am the sole developer, and I'm learning Swift/SwiftUI as I go.
